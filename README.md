## 📄 Overview

This repository contains the code, datasets (if permitted), and documentation related to my master's thesis project. The study investigates learning gaps in MOOCs using a combination of clustering and causal analysis methods, with an aim to provide actionable educational insights.

## 🧪 Research Objectives

1. Extend and adapt clustering algorithms (K-means, DBSCAN) for MOOC-specific challenges.
2. Identify engagement patterns linked to learning gaps using temporal and feature-based clustering.
3. Use causal inference techniques (SHAP values, decision trees) to explain contributing factors behind learning gaps.
